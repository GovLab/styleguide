# govlab-styleguide

A styleguide / lightweight frontend framework for GovLab websites.

This is a living styleguide generated by [kss-node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) and based on a super lightweight custom build of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), which aims to be easily reusable for any project within the GovLab ecosystem.  If you are interested in contributing, check out the [Development](#dev) section below.

## Getting Started <a name="start"></a>

To use the styleguide in your project, simply run the following command in the base directory of your project:
```
npm install --save-dev govlab-styleguide
```

## Development <a name="dev"></a>

To get set up to develop this repo, simply:
```
git clone https://github.com/GovLab/styleguide.git
cd styleguide
npm install
```

After you have made some changes, and made sure to update the KSS comments for your change, run:
```
./node_modules/.bin/kss-node --config kss-config.json
```
to update the living documentation.

Finally, submit a pull request with your changes.

*NOTE: This process should get way easier in the future, hang tight :3*
