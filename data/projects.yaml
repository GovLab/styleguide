  problem_statement: Does targeting expertise within government accelerate innovation? #question
  short_description:
  tooltip: >
    <p></p>
  long_description: >
    <p>An expert network to match innovative individuals, organizations and the projects they have worked on within and across governments. NoI adopts a more nuanced way of sharing and finding expertise — one that looks beyond traditional credentials to focus on real world know-how. Instead of rigid categories or open-ended tags, NoI attempts to get at what people know by asking the kinds of questions they could answer. In response to those questions, they can specify the expertise they have and want to share: whether they have the ability to do something, to tell someone about it, or to refer them to others knowledgeable about the topic.</p>
  background: >
    <p>There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to enable our governing organizations to recognize and implement innovative and effective solutions to problems. Administration that is supposed to solve critical problems on its own is inadequate for a complex, networked world. Governments need to learn to make use of the expertise of others — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, skills and experiences inside and outside of government — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years.</p>

    <p>This project is still in its infancy with deployments of the platform in eight countries anticipated during 2015. The anticipated impact, however, is greater understanding and demonstration of how targeting people -- in this case government employees -- on the basis of their skills can accelerate innovation.</p>

    <p>Docker for Data is a cloud-based software toolkit to speed up the extraction and loading of large open datasets. Using Docker for Data, a user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours. Docker for Data helps to answer the question: how do we make open data more useful?</p>
  tooltip: >
    Users no longer have to worry about schemas, transformations, load processes, or waiting for slow data portals. Data from many formats is standardized and ready to go, fast. Installation is a snap: users don’t even need a SQL database installed beforehand. Docker for Data can be installed with <a href="https://github.com/talos/docker4data#try-it-out">one line of code</a>.

    <p>For example, New York City maintains a free dataset online containing every deed and mortgage, back to 1966 (“open data”).  Although these records could make it possible to understand economic development, urban revitalization, migration trends, and more, the dataset is so big and so little documented that a researcher, entrepreneur or student might need a full day just to get the data into a database. With Docker, this data set is now converted into XXXX</p>

    <p>The GovLab Public Projects Canvas is a 20-question fillable form available to help public interest innovators develop more effective projects. The Canvas platform enables teams to collaborate on drafting. Each question has a comments field to facilitate mentors and experts offering feedback.</p>

    <p>Based on our experience <a href="http://govlabacademy.org/">teaching civic innovators</a>, the GovLab developed the Public Projects Canvas, a worksheet to help those working on civic projects for the common good become more impactful. This canvas includes twenty questions helps problem solvers cross the Valley of Death. According to Forbes, the “valley of death” is a common term in the startup world, referring to the difficulty of covering the negative cash flow in the early stages of a startup, before a new product generates revenue. But when you are passionate about solving a public problem, the common deathraps include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Defining the problem clearly enough in order to develop a solution that really works;</li>
    <li>Knowing how to navigate the necessary bureaucracies, legal regimes, and institutions to get things done;</li>
    <li>Developing materials compelling enough to persuade the “no machines” you must convince;</li>
    <li>Identifying how to measure what works.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Canvas has supported coaching programs for 80+ project teams from 20+ countries with the assistance of faculty members and coaches from 5 universities and a variety of governments NGOs such as the World Bank and companies as well as  12 semester-long Masters-level academic courses delivered to students from several professional schools at NYU, MIT, and Arizona State University, as well as to more than 70 non-credit participants from more than a dozen US cities and half a dozen foreign countries. In aggregate, 500+ participants working on 250 projects have used the Canvas.</p>

    <p>The Data Collaboratives Directory is a repository and taxonomy of case studies showing how public and private organizations work together to exchange data. The Directory seeks to enable those exploring the value and practice of data. The GovLab and partners are also developing the first iteration of a practical toolkit to help those wishing to create new data collaboratives or accelerate those already in place. collaboratives to learn more about their value propositions, use cases, technical arrangements, legal frameworks, andpotential impact for the public good. Taken together, these case studies can also demonstrate the proof of concept necessary to build a foundation for future research and the acceleration of data collaboratives.</p>

    <p>Several of society’s greatest challenges — from addressing climate change to public health to job creation — require greater access to data. Yet for all the potential for using big data, a limiting factor is that much of the data valuable for solving public problems resides within the private sector. If we truly want to leverage the potential of data to improve people’s lives, then we need to accelerate the creation and use of “data collaboratives” in which participants from different sectors — including private companies, research institutions, and government agencies — can exchange data to help solve public problems.</p>
