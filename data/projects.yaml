    <p>Docker for Data is a cloud-based open source toolkit to speed up the extraction and loading of large open datasets. It gives open data users a command that can install a broad variety of data sets into a SQL database directly. A user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours. </p>

    <p>Docker for Data is a cloud-based open source toolkit to speed up the extraction and loading of large open datasets. It gives open data users a command that can install a broad variety of data sets into a SQL database directly. A user can load data like New York City’s deeds and mortgages directly into a powerful SQL database in just minutes instead of hours.</p>
    <p>Users no longer have to worry about schemas, transformations, load processes, or waiting for slow data portals.  Data from many formats is standardized and ready to go, fast. Installation is a snap: users don’t even need a SQL database installed beforehand. Docker for Data can be installed with <a href="https://github.com/talos/docker4data#try-it-out" target="_blank">one line of code</a>.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Existing open data portals are focused on views of single data sets in the browser. This is great until you need to do deep analysis or build a business on it.</p>
    <p>Downloading big datasets can take hours. It can take many more hours finding the location of important small datasets, especially those not living on the same portal. Add in a few more hours to load everything into a real database and figure out the relations, and you've spent days (or thousands of dollars) on something trivial. </p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be this hard.</p>

    <p>At GovLab, we are using canvas for our internal projects and also for the coaching of 'students' in the context of the GovLab Academy. A canvas is a good way to bootstrap a brand new project. It can be also very useful for existing projects or even past projects.</p>

    <p>According to Forbes, the Valley of Death is a common term in the startup world, referring to the difficulty of covering the negative cash flow in the early stages of a startup. For most Public interest projects,  the common death-traps include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defining the problem clearly</li>
      <li>Knowing how to navigate the necessary bureaucracies</li>
      <li>Developing compelling materials to convince the decision-makers</li>
      <li>Identifying how to measure what works.</li>

    <p>Canvases - proven frameworks to facilitate idea generation & structured discussions - have been widely used by companies and entrepreneurs; but not so much by non-profits or social actors, as they haven’t been able to capture the challenges that are unique to social and public ventures.</p>

  background: >
    <p>Several of society’s greatest challenges — from addressing climate change to public health to job creation — require greater access to data. Yet for all the potential for using big data, a limiting factor is that much of the data valuable for solving public problems resides within the private sector. If we truly want to leverage the potential of data to improve people’s lives, then we need to accelerate the creation and use of “data collaboratives” in which participants from different sectors — including private companies, research institutions, and government agencies — can exchange data to help solve public problems.</p>

The OD500 is the first comprehensive study of U.S. based companies that use open government data as a key business resource. The name “OD500” originates from the research ambition to identify 500 U.S. companies that are using open government data.

    <p>An expert network to match innovative individuals, organizations and the projects they have worked on within and across governments. NoI adopts a more nuanced way of sharing and finding expertise — one that looks beyond traditional credentials to focus on real world know-how. Instead of rigid categories or open-ended tags, NoI attempts to get at what people know by asking the kinds of questions they could answer. In response to those questions, they can specify the expertise they have and want to share: whether they have the ability to do something, to tell someone about it, or to refer them to others knowledgeable about the topic.</p>

  background: >
    <p>There is possibly no more important public issue today than how to enable our governing organizations to recognize and implement innovative and effective solutions to problems. Administrations that are supposed to solve critical problems on their own are inadequate for a complex, networked world. Governments need to learn to make use of the expertise of others — formal scientific knowledge and credentials, skills and experiences inside and outside of government — to tackle the challenges society will face in the coming years.</p>

    <p>The GovLab is designing and operationalizing an expert network tool at NYU where data science expertise can be found and made manifest by internal users as well as external decision-makers like policymakers in the White House, Congress, and other public institutions. The goal is to overcome the practical problem that there is currently no way for policymakers to find specialized outside expertise quickly. In developing a working prototype, we are testing the hypothesis that when people are matched to the right opportunity to answer compelling questions on the basis of their skills, they are more likely to use their skills to solve public policy dilemmas.</p>
  background: >
    <p>In mid-2013, The GovLab was invited to advise New York University on how to use cutting-edge Information & Communication Technology  tools and an open innovation process for collaborative decision-making. Called the Open Peer Engagement Network (Open NYU), the goal of the project has been to develop techniques and platforms for NYU to tap into the knowledge and talents that exist within its diverse community of students, faculty, staff, researchers, alumni and administrative leadership.</p>

    <p>Both corporate identities and activities remain too opaque and complex to get a full 3D view of any given company. To advance the goal of more comprehensive, reliable, and intelligible information about companies, the OrgPedia project aims to prototype the tools, processes and incentives for combining open government data, such as regulatory filings, with open private data, such as NGO reports, and crowdsourced data gathered from individuals about companies.</p>

    <p>Legisletters is an automatic web crawler that gathers and classifies letters written by Members of Congress from legislators' websites. Because letters often are published in ways that are difficult to automatically read, in particular PDF formats, we have a long-term vision of user participation to improve the quality of Legisletters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Engaging the offices of congresspeople to help them publish their documents in open formats.</li>
      <li>Asking users to improve the quality of existing letters by allowing them to classify different sections and fix errors.</li>
      <li>Permitting the addition of letters that have not been automatically discovered, both by link and upload.</li>
    </ul>
  background: >
    <p>Members of Congress send formal “oversight” letters to cabinet departments and independent agencies on a dizzying array of topics. These letters can contain many different kinds of “asks” of the executive branch, including issuing or revising a particular regulation, changing an interpretation of an existing rule, initiating an investigation and many others. Such communication is a core component of Congress’s oversight work and a key way for Members to shape policy. Yet, there exists no simple, accessible way to discover which Members have written which agencies on which issues, and with what outcomes. The Legisletters project aims to fix that by creating a living, searchable archive of the formal letters that Members of Congress send.</p>

    <p>In an effort to safeguard the legitimacy and fairness of the grantmaking process, public funding agencies have traditionally done grantmaking behind closed doors. Whether to states or individuals, introducing greater openness at all stages of the grantmaking process has the potential to spur more creative problem-solving strategies and, ultimately, more effective outcomes because open processes enable greater diversity of expertise to be brought to bear.</p>

    <p>Through a guided interview, the Crowdsourcing Advisor not only helps to identify the key elements one must consider when designing a crowdsourcing project, but also provides a report of the most important case studies (drawn from our knowledge-base) and learnings tailored to the needs and circumstances of the user.</p>
  background: >
    <p>Knowing when and how to use crowdsourcing is hard: there are more than 40 different definitions of crowdsourcing; there is little conclusive evidence of what works and when and, even though there is an abundance of tools and examples, information is disorganized and not well-suited to help a decision-maker know what to do. Under the assumption that there is no single right way of doing crowdsourcing but, rather, engagement must be tailored to each needs and circumstances, the Advisor builds on the experience of others and attempts to help decision-makers in the public and private sectors make an informed decision about when and how to use crowdsourcing.</p>

  problem_statement: How can data be used to increase public safety and reduce incarceration?
  short_description: >
    <p>Building on the GovLab’s experience in data-driven governance innovation in the fields of health care and education and working closely with a Criminal Justice Data and Innovation fellow working with the U.S. Chief Data Scientist at the White House, we are embarking on a year long project to analyze and document how data flows through the criminal justice system, identify policy and legal barriers to effective data sharing, and create pilot projects to replicate successful innovations in the field or test new approaches. Recognizing that many jurisdictions have already tackled these problems, we are actively seeking insights from experts in the field at the local, state and federal level to identify innovation already occurring, brainstorm new approaches, and build out key policies to help improve and expand criminal justice data sharing.</p>
  long_description: 
  background: >
    <p>Jurisdictions across the country have found success implementing new evidence-based practices to reduce jail and prison populations, link more people with effective treatment in their communities, and generate cost savings without corresponding increases in crime; yet challenges in collecting, sharing and analyzing data continue to present significant barriers to widespread adoption of proven reforms and stifle opportunities for new innovation.</p>
